Everything from making detailed backstories to fictional characters to brainstorming how to finish a sentence. Here my intentions are to go through some of my findings regarding using ChatGPT to help me with my work. Specifically incident investigation in Sentinel.\n\n## Using ChatGPT for Incident Triage in Azure Sentinel\n\nOne of the key tasks in incident management is triaging incidents to determine their severity, priority, and next steps for resolution. ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in this process, providing relevant information and guidance based on the incident name and description. By using natural language processing, ChatGPT can quickly understand the context of an incident and provide insights that can help accelerate the triage and investigation process.\n\n## ChatGPT in Action\n\nHere's an example scenario to illustrate how ChatGPT can assist with incident triage in Azure Sentinel:\n\nHere an Azure Sentinel alert is triggered for an anomalous single factor login. The incident is named \"anomalous single factor login\" and the description goes further into what the analytics rule investigates and where to start investigating deeper. Then you have some entities like device, user, and IP. \n\n![](./media/incidentchatgpt.jpg)\n\nBy asking ChatGPT through a Logic App, we can give an analyst some quick start steps so the analyst quickly can determine the severity of the threat and take appropriate action. An example of a comment like this can be seen here: \n\n![](./media/commentchatgpt.jpg)\n\nThis is achieved by integrating the ChatGPT API into a simple Logic App. Here we ask for concrete steps to do incident management based on different fields like the title, description, and entities available through Sentinel's integration with the Logic App.\"\n\n**My app looks like this**\n\n![](./media/logicappchatgpt.jpg)\n\n## Advantages of Using ChatGPT for Incident Management in Azure Sentinel\nUsing ChatGPT for incident management in Sentinel offers several advantages, including:\n\n### Triage and starting the investigation\nThe most value we have seen is ease of triage and starting the investigation. This is so the analyst quickly can get a good overview of the incident then take good decisions on how to handle the incident\n\n### Faster resolution times\n\nThe more efficient start of incident handling with ChatGPT can provide good information so the resolution of incidents goes faster and often with greater confidence.\n\n### Improved efficiency\n\nHaving analyst spend less time on consolidating information when ChatGPT can summarize it quickly improves efficiency more than one would think. Furthermore, we can use ChatGPT to automate other parts of the incident management process, freeing up more analyst’s time to focus on more complex tasks.\n\n### Reduced risk\nChatGPT can help reduce the risk of human error in incident management, ensuring that the relevant actions are taken, and option paralysis is avoided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for incident triage and investigation in Sentinel it does not do the job for you but eases it by a lot. \n\n**BUT**, (there always seem to be one with AI) Let’s talk about data protection. All this testing was done in a development environment with less important data.\". I would not shove this into production today because incident management often handles very sensitive data that has no business floating around. As I personally do not trust the API connection enough. All the concerns and discussions I’ve read so far. Have all had an echo of you should not feed it sensitive data although ChatGPT no longer \"learns\"\n\nHere is what ChatGPT said itself about feeding it sensitive info:\n\n**Me:**\n\n\"What are concerns around feeding you or other AI models like you with sensitive info?\"\n\n**ChatGPT:**\n\n\"There are several concerns around feeding AI models with sensitive information, including:\n- Data privacy: Sensitive information, such as personal information or confidential business data, may be at risk of being leaked or used for malicious purposes.\n- Bias: AI models may perpetuate and amplify existing biases in the data they are trained on, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions and decisions.\n- Responsibility: It may be unclear who is responsible for the consequences of decisions made by AI models, especially if they result in harm.\n- Security: AI models can be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which could result in the theft or manipulation of sensitive information.\n- Regulation: There may be limited regulations in place to govern the collection, storage, and use of sensitive information by AI models, leaving room for abuse.\n- Explain ability: AI models can be seen as \"black boxes\", meaning that their decision-making processes can be difficult to understand or interpret, making it challenging to ensure they are making ethical decisions.\n\n> It is important to consider these concerns and implement measures to mitigate them when using AI models, such as data privacy policies, bias mitigation techniques, and transparent and explainable AI.\"\n","timeToRead":4.005,"tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#sentinel-and-chatgpt","title":"Sentinel and ChatGPT","items":[{"url":"#using-chatgpt-for-incident-triage-in-azure-sentinel","title":"Using ChatGPT for Incident Triage in Azure Sentinel"},{"url":"#chatgpt-in-action","title":"ChatGPT in Action"},{"url":"#advantages-of-using-chatgpt-for-incident-management-in-azure-sentinel","title":"Advantages of Using ChatGPT for Incident Management in Azure Sentinel","items":[{"url":"#triage-and-starting-the-investigation","title":"Triage and starting the investigation"},{"url":"#faster-resolution-times","title":"Faster resolution times"},{"url":"#improved-efficiency","title":"Improved efficiency"},{"url":"#reduced-risk","title":"Reduced risk"},{"url":"#conclusion","title":"Conclusion"}]}]}]},"frontmatter":{"author":[{"id":"b172751f-feee-5115-bb34-349667be74ea","yamlId":"bendikaarvik","name":"Bendik Aarvik","initial":"BA","bio":"Cloud Engineer, Amesto Fortytwo\n","sns":[["linkedin","https://www.linkedin.com/in/bendik-aarvik/"],["github","https://github.com/benaarvik"],["mailto","mailto:bendik.aarvik@amesto.no"]],"avatar":{"normal":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBQQG/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB6aJ1miiPI3hpg//EABwQAAMAAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEEBESE//aAAgBAQABBQKrFUnVjTK2nxNgrdti5bNK58v/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AR//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/AR//xAAeEAABBAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIRIRASQVFxgf/aAAgBAQAGPwKuUGkgzjTNqXV3kTsvV//EABsQAQEBAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFx/9oACAEBAAE/ISzNYr4YWwOITTeB2yHxvyyPpgzjrigvGvHGcb//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEADHPP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8QH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8QH//EACAQAQACAQMFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAEAETFBYaEhUYGRseH/2gAIAQEAAT8QIEG5a/PMYpBXSmSHT+RlrCGovVwSxjRX1HI+ooIo4YO2X+yk33e7LEocsYKGuZ//2Q=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1d542bcfe8e80ef944c4466efed0acc4/19e71/bendik.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1d542bcfe8e80ef944c4466efed0acc4/77b35/bendik.jpg 32w,\n/static/1d542bcfe8e80ef944c4466efed0acc4/d4a57/bendik.jpg 64w,\n/static/1d542bcfe8e80ef944c4466efed0acc4/19e71/bendik.jpg 128w,\n/static/1d542bcfe8e80ef944c4466efed0acc4/68974/bendik.jpg 256w","sizes":"(min-width: 128px) 128px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":128,"height":128}}}}],"title":"Streamlining Incident Management with ChatGPT","description":"My latest obsession, like many others, has been ChatGPT.
